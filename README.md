### *The TikTok you never asked for. Powered by AI. Built to steal your soul.*

## 👁️ What is this?

**The Real Doomscroll** is an AI-powered TikTok clone with *infinite*, *personalized*, *addictive* content — generated in real time by machines that don't sleep and don’t care about your mental health.

This is a **2-day hackathon experiment** by [**Obvious**](#-about-obvious), the French art collective exploring the frontiers of artificial intelligence and its societal impact. It’s a **proof of concept** that critiques the accelerating race for human attention.

> In a world where video generators like **LTX Studio** can produce video faster than you can watch it,  
> and where language models like **Qwen 1.7B** can design your next obsession in milliseconds...  
> we asked ourselves:  
> **What happens when TikTok becomes a generative, reactive, infinite loop?**

## 🧠 How it works

1. 🧠 **Qwen LLM** generates short TikTok-style narratives: a story + a matching video prompt + a matching voiceover.
2. 🎬 **LTX Video Generator** turns the prompt into an actual short video.
3. 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech** transforms the story into an eerie robotic voice.
4. 📱 The result: A fresh AI-made TikTok in your feed.
5. ⏱️ Your behavior — how long you watch vs skip — is fed back into the loop.
6. 🔁 The AI learns what grabs your attention.
7. 🧲 It tries again. Stronger. Creepier. Better.

Repeat until your will breaks or your battery dies.

## 🎭 Why?

Because **we’re artists.**  
Because **we’re terrified.**  
Because **this is where things are headed.**

This is not a startup.  
This is not a pitch deck.  
This is not a call to raise your Series A.

> **The Real Doomscroll** is an _artistic autopsy_ of social media in its final, AI-driven phase:  
> a future where your attention is the only currency,  
> and the algorithm is the only god.

We made this because we **can**, and because one day someone else will — but won’t tell you it’s an artwork.

## 🖼️ About Obvious

[**Obvious**](https://obvious.art) is a French trio of artists and researchers using AI to push the boundaries of creativity.

We were the first to sell an AI-generated artwork at **Christie’s New York** in 2018. Since then, our work has been exhibited in major museums worldwide, and in collaborations with **Nike, Alpine**, and the **Opéra de Paris**.

In 2023, we launched our own AI research lab with **Sorbonne University**, dedicated to inventing new tools for artistic creation.  
In 2024, we visualized human imagination from MRI scans using AI — a project showcased in **Paris and Seoul**.

Through our art, we explore both the **power** and the **dangers** of AI.  
**The Real Doomscroll** is not a product.  
It’s a mirror.  
Look closely.
